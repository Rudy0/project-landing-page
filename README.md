# Landing Page Project


## Details

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project.
I converted from a static project to an interactive one: 

*Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.

*While scrolling through the page each section is highlighted when in viewport.

*When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scrolls to the appropriate section.
